Builds a native image using libmusl as the libc implementation.
Usage: -H:UseMuslC=<path to musl bundle>
---------
The musl bundle path should contain the following structure:
- include
- lib
Under those two folders, the following libraries must be available:
- musl
- zlib
- libstdc++ (if using libsunec)

One of the ways of constructing the bundle:
1. Create a folder for the bundle
2. Download musl sources
3. Configure musl to use the path to the bundle as the install destination
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for zlib
5. For libstdc++.a, the easiest way to download it from the Alpine distribution.
The harder way is to compile it yourself. libstdc++ comes as part of gcc. To compile it yourself and use it means to
compile GCC using musl and rip it from the result.
