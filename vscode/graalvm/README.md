## Features

### GraalVM Installation and Setup

Upon the extension installation, the user is requested to provide a path to the GraalVM home directory.

![Image No Path](images/no-path-to-graalvm.png)

To that purpose, the following commands can be used:
* __Select GraalVM Installation__ - Provides the UI to select an already installed GraalVM.<p>
![Image Select GraalVM](images/select-graalvm.png)<p>
By default, the following locations are searched for an already installed GraalVM:
    * the extension's global storage
    * `/opt` folder as the default RPM install location
    * `PATH` environment variable content
    * `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable content
    * `JAVA_HOME` environment variable content

* __Install GraalVM__ - Downloads the latest GraalVM release from [Github](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases) and installs it within the extension's global storage.

Once the path to the GraalVM home directory is provided, the GraalVM is checked for presence of the optional components:
* [Native image](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/)
* [Python interpreter](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/python)
* [R interpreter](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/r)
* [Ruby interpreter](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/ruby)

User is provided with an option of an automatic installation of the missing components.

![Image No Python Component](images/no-python-component.png)

The folowing commandÂ can be used to install any missing GraalVM component manually:
* __Install GraalVM Component__

![Image Component Install](images/component-install.png)

All three commands can be invoked at any time from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)

### JavaScript and Node.js Debugging

To debug a JavaScript or Node.js application running on GraalVM, creating a launch configuration for the application is necessary. To do so, open the applicarion project folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder) and then select the Configure gear icon on the Debug view top bar. If debugging is not yet configured (no `launch.json` has been created), select `GraalVM` from the list of available debug environmnets. Once the `launch.json` file is opened in the editor, one of the following techniques can be used to add a new configuration:
* Use IntelliSense if your cursor is located inside the configurations array.
* Press the Add Configuration button to invoke snippet IntelliSense at the start of the array.
* Choose Add Configuration option in the Debug menu.

![Image Debug Configurations](images/debug-config.png)

The GraalVM extension provides the following debug configurations that can be used to debug an applications running on GraalVM:
* __Launch Node.js Application__ - Launches a Node.js Application using GraalVM in a debug mode.
* __Launch JavaScript__ - Launches a JavaScript using GraalVM in a debug mode.
* __Attach__ - Attaches debugger to a locally running GraalVM.
* __Attach to Remote__ - Attaches debugger to the debug port of a remote GraalVM.

![Image Debug Configuration for Node.js](images/nodejs-debug-config.png)

Note that the attributes available in launch configurations vary from configuration to configuration. You can use IntelliSense suggestions (Ctrl+Space) to find out which attributes exist for a specific debug configuration. Hover help is also available for all attributes.

![Image Select Debug Configuration](images/select-debug-config.png)

In order to start a debug session, first select the proper configuration using the Configuration drop-down in the Debug view. Once you have your launch configuration set, start your debug session with F5. Alternatively you can run your configuration through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), by filtering on Debug: Select and Start Debugging or typing 'debug ', and selecting the configuration you want to debug.

### Polyglot Applications Debugging

To run a polyglot application using the GraalVM, user has to either pass the `--polyglot` option to any of the existing application lauchers (e.g. `js --polyglot`, `node --polyglot`) or use an experimental launcher called `polyglot` that runs code for JavaScript, Ruby, and R without requiring the selection of a primary language. The `polyglot` launcher does not require the `--polyglot` option, it is enabled by default. For more information see the [GraalVM polyglot documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/polyglot/).

To debug a polyglot application using the GraalVM, creating a launch configuration for the application is necessary. To do so, open the applicarion project folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder) and then select the Configure gear icon on the Debug view top bar. If debugging is not yet configured (no `launch.json` has been created), select `GraalVM` from the list of available debug environmnets. Once the `launch.json` file is opened in the editor, one of the following techniques can be used to add a new configuration:
* Use IntelliSense if your cursor is located inside the configurations array.
* Press the Add Configuration button to invoke snippet IntelliSense at the start of the array.
* Choose Add Configuration option in the Debug menu.

![Image Debug Configurations](images/debug-config-polyglot.png)

The GraalVM extension provides the following debug configuration that can be used to debug an applications running on GraalVM using the `polyglot` launcher:
* __Launch Polyglot Application__ - Launches a Polyglot Application in debug mode.

Alternatively, to pass the `--polyglot` option to any of the existing application lauchers, add the `runtimeArgs` attribute containing the `--polyglot` value to their respective debug configurations. Note that in some cases (polyglot application calls Java or R, or native launcher accesses languages installed with `gu` without [rebuilding images](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/install-components/#rebuilding-images)), passing also the `--jvm` option is necessary.

### Language Server Integration

GraalVM supports smart editing features of development tools used to create guest language applications by providing a built-in implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol). This allows you to attach compatible development tools such as VS Code to GraalVM and to get features like auto complete, go to declaration, or documentation on hover.

Currently, the GraalVM Language Server implementation supports the following services:
* [Text Document Synchronization](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_synchronization)
* [Hover Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_hover)
* [Completion Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_completion)
* [Signature Help Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_signatureHelp)
* [Document Highlight Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_documentHighlight)
* [Code Action Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_codeAction)
* [Code Lens Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocument_codeLens)
* [Execute Command Provider](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#workspace_executeCommand)

Note: GraalVM Language Server is offered as a technology preview and requires to pass the --experimental-options option for its activation.

To start the GraalVM Language Server, pass the `--lsp` option to the command-line launcher as in the following example with a Node.js application:
```
$ node --experimental-options --lsp app.js
[Graal LSP] Starting server and listening on localhost/127.0.0.1:8123
Example app listening on port 3000!
```
Note that the GraalVM Language Server itself does not provide the static data usually gathered by parsing the application sources (as these data are sometimes fuzzy in case of dynamic languages). Instead, the GraalVM Language Server was designed to provide the accurate dynamic data gathered form the application runtime.

![Image Language Server Completion](images/lsp-dynamic-completion.png)

However, the GraalVM Language Server could delegate to the existing language servers written specially for the particular languages (using the `--lsp.Delegates` launcher option) and merge the static data returned from these servers with its own dynamic data to a single result.

This extension works as a client to the GraalVM Language Server. By default, a language server is started as a part of every process being executed or debugged via VS Code UI. The other possibility (available on option) is a language server started as a separated process that gets informed about every application being executed or debugged. It tries to "dry-run" the same code as the original application and serve the runetime data afterwards. Currently, both approaches start the language server providing the smart editing features for the following Truffle Languages - JavaScript, Python, R, Ruby, and SimpleLanguage.

### R Language Server

This extension provides an option to automatically install and run the [languageserver](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) which is an implementation of the Language Server Protocol for the language of R. Enabling this option, the GraalVM R installation is checked for presence of the `languageserver` package and user is provided with an option of an automatic installation of the missing package.

![Image No R Language Server](images/no-r-ls.png)

Once the `languageserver` package is installed, the R Language Server is automatically started and passed to the GraalVM Language Server as delegate when necessary.

### Ruby Language Server

This extension provides an option to automatically install and run the [solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) which is an implementation of the Language Server Protocol for the language of Ruby. Enabling this option, the GraalVM Ruby installation is checked for presence of the `solargraph` gem and user is provided with an option of an automatic installation of the missing gem.

![Image No Ruby Language Server](images/no-ruby-ls.png)

Once the `solargraph` gem is installed, the Ruby Language Server is automatically started and passed to the GraalVM Language Server as delegate when necessary.

### Additional Editor Features

Since an easy writing of [polyglot](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/polyglot) applications is one of the defining features of GraalVM, the code completion invoked inside JavaScript sources provides items for `Polyglot.eval(...)`, `Polyglot.evalFile(...)` and `Java.type(...)` calls.

![Image Code Completion](images/code-completion-js.png)

Similarly, the code completion invoked inside Python sources provides items for `Polyglot.eval(...)`, `Polyglot.eval_file(...)` and `Java.type(...)` calls.

![Image Code Completion](images/code-completion-python.png)

The code completion invoked inside R sources provides items for `eval.polyglot(...)` and `new("<Java type>", ...)` calls.

![Image Code Completion](images/code-completion-r.png)

And finally, the code completion invoked inside Ruby sources provides items for `Polyglot.eval(...)`, `Polyglot.eval_file(...)` and `Java.type(...)` calls.

![Image Code Completion](images/code-completion-ruby.png)

For JavaScript, Python, R, and Ruby sources opened in editor, all the `Polyglot.eval(...)` calls are detected and the respective embedded languages are injected to their locations. For example, having an R code snippet called via the Polyglot API from inside a JavaScript source, the R language code is embedded inside the corresponding JavaScript string and all VS Code's editing features (syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto closing pairs, code completion, etc.) treat the content of the string as the R source code.
