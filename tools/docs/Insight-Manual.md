# [GraalVM Insight](Insight.md): Hacker's Handle to the Ultimate Insights Gathering Framework

GraalVM [Insight](Insight.md) is multipurpose, flexible tool that greatly reduces
the effort of writing reliable microservices solutions. The dynamic nature
of [Insight](Insight.md) helps everyone to selectively apply complex tracing
pointcuts on already deployed applications running at full speed.
[Insight](Insight.md) further blurs the difference between various DevOps tasks -
code once, apply your insights anytime, anywhere!

Any moderately skilled hacker can easily create own 
so called [Insight](Insight.md) snippets and dynamically apply them to
the actual programs. That provides ultimate insights into
execution and behavior of one's application without compromising the speed
of the execution. Let's get started with an obligatory Hello World example.

### Hello World!

Create a simple `source-tracing.js` script with following content:

```js
insight.on('source', function(ev) {
    print(`Loading ${ev.characters.length} characters from ${ev.name}`);
});
```
launch your GraalVM's `bin/node` launcher with the `--insight` instrument and
observe what scripts are being loaded and evaluated:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/node --experimental-options --js.print --insight=source-tracing.js -e "print('The result: ' + 6 * 7)" | tail -n 10
Loading 29938 characters from url.js
Loading 345 characters from internal/idna.js
Loading 12642 characters from punycode.js
Loading 33678 characters from internal/modules/cjs/loader.js
Loading 13058 characters from vm.js
Loading 52408 characters from fs.js
Loading 15920 characters from internal/fs/utils.js
Loading 505 characters from [eval]-wrapper
Loading 29 characters from [eval]
The result: 42
```

What has just happened? GraalVM Insight `source-tracing.js` script has used
the provided `insight` object to attach a *source* listener to the runtime.
As such, whenever the *node.js* framework loaded a script,
the listener got notified of it and could take an action - in this case
printing the length and name of processed script.

### Histogram - Use Full Power of Your Language!

Collecting the insights information isn't limited to simple print statement.
One can perform any Turing complete computation in your language. Imagine
following `function-histogram-tracing.js` that counts all method invocations
and dumps the most frequent ones when the execution of your program is over:

```js
var map = new Map();

function dumpHistogram() {
    print("==== Histogram ====");
    var digits = 3;
    Array.from(map.entries()).sort((one, two) => two[1] - one[1]).forEach(function (entry) {
        var number = entry[1].toString();
        if (number.length >= digits) {
            digits = number.length;
        } else {
            number = Array(digits - number.length + 1).join(' ') + number;
        }
        if (number > 10) print(`${number} calls to ${entry[0]}`);
    });
    print("===================");
}

insight.on('enter', function(ev) {
    var cnt = map.get(ev.name);
    if (cnt) {
        cnt = cnt + 1;
    } else {
        cnt = 1;
    }
    map.set(ev.name, cnt);
}, {
    roots: true
});

insight.on('close', dumpHistogram);
```

The `map` is a global variable visible for the whole **Insight** script that 
allows the code to share data between the `insight.on('enter')` function and the `dumpHistogram`
function. The latter is executed when the `node` process execution is over (registered via
`insight.on('close', dumpHistogram)`. Invoke as:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/node --experimental-options --js.print --insight=function-histogram-tracing.js -e "print('The result: ' + 6 * 7)"
The result: 42
=== Histogram ===
543 calls to isPosixPathSeparator
211 calls to E
211 calls to makeNodeErrorWithCode
205 calls to NativeModule
198 calls to uncurryThis
154 calls to :=>
147 calls to nativeModuleRequire
145 calls to NativeModule.compile
 55 calls to internalBinding
 53 calls to :anonymous
 49 calls to :program
 37 calls to getOptionValue
 24 calls to copyProps
 18 calls to validateString
 13 calls to copyPrototype
 13 calls to hideStackFrames
 13 calls to addReadOnlyProcessAlias
=================
```

Table with names and counts of function invocations is printed out when the
`node` process exits.

### Not Limited to Node

So far the examples used `node.js`, but the **Insight** system isn't tight
to Node.js at all - it is available in all the environments GraalVM provides.
Let's try it on `bin/js` - pure JavaScript implementation that comes with 
GraalVM. Let's define `function-tracing.js` script as:

```js
var count = 0;
var next = 8;

insight.on('enter', function(ev) {
    if (count++ % next === 0) {
        print(`Just called ${ev.name} as ${count} function invocation`);
        next *= 2;
    }
}, {
    roots: true
});
```

and run it on top of [sieve.js](../../vm/benchmarks/agentscript/sieve.js) -
a sample script which uses a variant of the Sieve of Erathostenes to compute one hundred
thousand of prime numbers:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js --experimental-options --insight=function-tracing.js sieve.js | grep -v Computed
Just called :program as 1 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 17 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 33 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 65 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 129 function invocation
Just called Filter as 257 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 513 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 1025 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 2049 function invocation
Just called Natural.next as 4097 function invocation
```

**Insight** scripts are ready to be used in any environment - be it the
default `node` implementation, the lightweight `js` command line tool - 
or your own application that decides to [embedd GraalVM scripting](Insight-Embedding.md)
capabilities!

### Trully Polyglot - Insight any Language

The previous examples were written in JavaScript, but due to the polyglot
nature of GraalVM, we can take the same instrument and use it 
in a program written in the Ruby language.
Here is an example - create `source-trace.js` file:

```js
insight.on('source', function(ev) {
   if (ev.uri.indexOf('gems') === -1) {
     let n = ev.uri.substring(ev.uri.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
     print('JavaScript instrument observed load of ' + n);
   }
});
```

and prepare your Ruby file `helloworld.rb` (make sure GraalVM Ruby is
installed with `gu install ruby`):

```ruby
puts 'Hello from GraalVM Ruby!'
```

when you apply the JavaScript instrument to the Ruby program, here is what
you get:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/ruby --polyglot --experimental-options --insight=source-trace.js helloworld.rb
JavaScript instrument observed load of helloworld.rb
Hello from GraalVM Ruby!
```

It is necessary to start GraalVM's Ruby launcher with `--polyglot` parameter
as the `source-tracing.js` script remains written in JavaScript. That's all
fine - mixing languages has never been a problem for GraalVM!

### Minimal Overhead

With all the power the **Insight** framework brings, it is fair to ask what's
the overhead when the insights are applied? The overhead of course depends
on what your scripts do. When they add and spread complex computations
all around your code base, then the price for the computation will be payed.
However, that would be overhead of your code, not of the instrumentation! Let's
thus measure overhead of a simple `function-count.js` script:

```js
var count = 0;
function dumpCount() {
    print(`${count} functions have been executed`);
}

insight.on('enter', function(ev) {
    count++;
}, {
    roots: true
});

insight.on('close', dumpCount);
```

Let's use the script on fifty iterations of [sieve.js](../../vm/benchmarks/agentscript/sieve.js)
sample which uses a variant of the Sieve of Erathostenes to compute one hundred
thousand of prime numbers. Repeating the computation fifty times gives the
runtime a chance to warm up and properly optimize. Here is the optimal run:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js sieve.js | grep -v Computed
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 75 ms
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 73 ms
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 73 ms
```

and now let's compare it to execution time when running with the **Insight** script enabled:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js --experimental-options --insight=function-count.js sieve.js  | grep -v Computed
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 74 ms
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 74 ms
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 75 ms
72784921 functions have been executed

```

Two milliseconds!? Seriously? Yes, seriously. The **Insight** framework
blends the difference between application code and insight gathering scripts
making all the code work as one! The `count++` invocation becomes natural part of
the application at all the places representing `ROOT` of application functions.
**Insight** system gives you unlimited instrumentation power at no cost!

### Trully Polyglot - T-Tracing with Ruby

Not only one can instrument any GraalVM language, but also the **Insight**
scripts can be written in any GraalVM supported language. Take for example
Ruby and create `source-tracing.rb` (make sure GraalVM Ruby is installed via
`gu install ruby`) file:

```ruby
puts "Ruby: Initializing GraalVM Insight script"

insight.on('source', ->(ev) {
    name = ev[:name]
    puts "Ruby: observed loading of #{name}" 
})

puts 'Ruby: Hooks are ready!'
```

and then you can launch your `node` application and instrument it with such
Ruby written script:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/node --experimental-options --js.print --polyglot --insight=source-tracing.rb -e "print('With Ruby: ' + 6 * 7)" | grep Ruby:
Ruby: Initializing GraalVM Insight script
Ruby: Hooks are ready!
Ruby: observed loading of internal/per_context/primordials.js
Ruby: observed loading of internal/per_context/setup.js
Ruby: observed loading of internal/per_context/domexception.js
....
Ruby: observed loading of internal/modules/cjs/loader.js
Ruby: observed loading of vm.js
Ruby: observed loading of fs.js
Ruby: observed loading of internal/fs/utils.js
Ruby: observed loading of [eval]-wrapper
Ruby: observed loading of [eval]
With Ruby: 42
```

Write your **Insight** scripts in any language you wish! They'll be
ultimatelly useful accross the whole GraalVM ecosystem.

### Trully Polyglot - T-Tracing with R

The same instrument can be written in the R language opening tracing and
aspect based programing to our friendly statistical community. Just create
`agent-r.R` script:

```R
cat("R: Initializing GraalVM Insight script\n")

insight@on('source', function(env) {
    cat("R: observed loading of ", env$name, "\n")
})

cat("R: Hooks are ready!\n")
```

and use it to trace your `test.R` program:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/Rscript --insight=agent-r.R --experimental-options test.R
R: Initializing GraalVM Insight script
R: Hooks are ready!
R: observed loading of test.R
```

The only change is the R language. All the other [Insight](Insight.md)
features and 
[APIs](https://www.graalvm.org/tools/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/tools/agentscript/AgentScript.html#VERSION)
remain the same.

### Inspecting Values

**Insight** not only allows one to trace where the program execution is
happening, but it also offers access to values of local variables and function
arguments during execution. One can for example write instrument that shows
value of argument `n` in a function `fib`:

```js
insight.on('enter', function(ctx, frame) {
   print('fib for ' + frame.n);
}, {
   roots: true,
   rootNameFilter: 'fib'
});
```

This instrument uses second function argument `frame` to get access to values
of local variables inside of every instrumented function. 
The above **Insight** script also uses `rootNameFilter` to apply its hook only
to function named `fib`:

```js
function fib(n) {
  if (n < 1) return 0;
  if (n < 2) return 1;
  else return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
print("Two is the result " + fib(3));
```

When the instrument is stored in a `fib-trace.js` file and the actual code
in `fib.js`, then invoking following command yields detailed information about
the program execution and parameters passed between function invocations:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/node --experimental-options --js.print --insight=fib-trace.js fib.js
fib for 3
fib for 2
fib for 1
fib for 0
fib for 1
Two is the result 2
```

**Insight** is a perfect tool for polyglot, language agnostic aspect oriented
programming!

### Modifying Local Variables

Not only that **Insight** can access local variables, but it can also modify them. 
Imagine summing an array:

```js
function plus(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var sum = 0;
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].forEach((n) => sum = plus(sum, n));
print(sum);
```

which naturally leads to printing out number `45`. Let's apply following 
**Insight** script to ''erase'' non-even numbers before adding them:

```js
insight.on('enter', function zeroNonEvenNumbers(ctx, frame) {
    if (frame.b % 2 === 1) {
        frame.b = 0;
    }
}, {
    roots: true,
    rootNameFilter: 'plus'
});
```

When launched with `js --experimental-options --insight=erase.js sumarray.js`
only value `20` gets printed.

**Insight** `enter` and `return` hooks can only modify existing variables.
They cannot introduce new ones. Attempts to do so yield an exception.

### API of **Insight**

The **Insight** functionality is offered as a technology preview and 
requires one to use `--experimental-options` to enable the `--insight`
instrument. Never the less, the compatibility of the **Insight** API 
exposed via the `insight` object
is treated seriously.

The [documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/tools/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/tools/agentscript/AgentScript.html)
of the `insight` object properties and functions is available as part of its
[javadoc](https://www.graalvm.org/tools/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/tools/agentscript/AgentScript.html#VERSION).

Future versions will add new features, but whatever has
once been exposed, remains functional. If your script depends on some fancy new
feature, it may check version of the exposed API:

```js
print(`GraalVM Insight version is ${insight.version}`);
```

and act accordingly to the obtained version. New elements in the
[documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/tools/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/tools/agentscript/AgentScript.html)
carry associated `@since` tag to describe the minimimal version the associated
functionality/element is available since.

### Delaying **Insight** Initialization in **node.js**

**Insight** can be used in any GraalVM enabled environment including GraalVM's
`node` implementation. However, when in `node`, one doesn't want to write 
plain simple **Insight** scripts - one wants to use full power of `node` 
ecosystem including its modules. Here is a sample `agent-require.js` script that does it:

```js
let initialize = function (require) {
    let http = require("http");
    print(`${typeof http.createServer} http.createServer is available to the agent`);
}

let waitForRequire = function (event) {
  if (typeof process === 'object' && process.mainModule && process.mainModule.require) {
    insight.off('source', waitForRequire);
    initialize(process.mainModule.require.bind(process.mainModule));
  }
};

insight.on('source', waitForRequire, { roots: true });
```

The script solves an important problem: **Insight** scripts are
initialized as soon as possible and at that moment the `require` function isn't
yet ready. As such the script first attaches a listener on loaded scripts and when 
the main user script is being loaded, it obtains its `process.mainModule.require` 
function. Then it removes the probes using `insight.off` and invokes the actual 
`initialize` function to perform the real initialization while having 
access to all the node modules. The script can be used as

```js
$ graalvm/bin/node --experimental-options --js.print --insight=agent-require.js yourScript.js
```

This initialization sequence is known to work on GraalVM's node `v12.10.0`
launched with a main `yourScript.js` parameter.

### Handling Exceptions

The Insight agents can throw exceptions which are then propagated to the
surrounding user scripts. Imagine you have a program `seq.js`
logging various messages:

```js
function log(msg) {
    print(msg);
}

log('Hello GraalVM Insight!');
log('How');
log('are');
log('You?');
```

You can register an instrument `term.js` and terminate the execution in the middle
of the `seq.js` program execution based on observing the logged message:

```js
insight.on('enter', (ev, frame) => { 
    if (frame.msg === 'are') {
        throw 'great you are!';
    }
}, {
    roots: true,
    rootNameFilter: 'log'
});
```

The `term.js` instrument waits for a call to `log` function with message 'are'
and at that moment it emits its own exception effectively interrupting the user
program execution. As a result one gets:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js --polyglot --experimental-options --insight=term.js seq.js
Hello GraalVM Insight!
How
great you are!
        at <js> :=>(term.js:3:75-97)
        at <js> log(seq.js:1-3:18-36)
        at <js> :program(seq.js:7:74-83)
```

The exceptions emitted by Insight instruments are treated as regular language
exceptions. The `seq.js` program could use regular `try { ... } catch (e) { ... }`
block to catch them and deal with them as if they were emitted by the regular
user code.

### Hack into the C Code!

The polyglot capabilities of GraalVM know no limits. Not only it is possible
to interpret dynamic languages, but with the help of the
[lli launcher](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/llvm/)
one can mix in even *statically compiled* programs written in **C**, **C++**,
**Fortran**, **Rust**, etc.

Imagine you have a long running program just like
[sieve.c](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/vm/tests/all/agentscript/agent-sieve.c)
(which contains never-ending `for` loop in `main` method) and you'd like to give
it some execution quota. That is quite easy to do with GraalVM Insight! First
of all execute the program on GraalVM:

```bash
$ export TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`graalvm/bin/lli --print-toolchain-path`
$ ${TOOLCHAIN_PATH}/clang agent-sieve.c -lm -o sieve
$ graalvm/bin/lli sieve
```

Why toolchain? The GraalVM `clang` wrapper adds special options
instructing the regular `clang` to keep the LLVM bitcode information in the `sieve`
executable along the normal native code.
The GraalVM's `lli` interpreter can then use the bitcode to interpret the program
at full speed.  Btw. compare the result of direct native execution via `./sieve`
and interpreter speed of `graalvm/bin/lli sieve` - quite good result for an
interpreter, right?

Anyway let's focus on breaking the endless loop. You can do it with a JavaScript
`agent-limit.js` Insight script:

```js
var counter = 0;

insight.on('enter', function(ctx, frame) {
    if (++counter === 1000) {
        throw `GraalVM Insight: ${ctx.name} method called ${counter} times. enough!`;
    }
}, {
    roots: true,
    rootNameFilter: 'nextNatural'
});
```

The script counts the number of invocations of the C `nextNatural` function
and when the function gets invoked a thousand times, it emits an error
to terminate the `sieve` execution. Just run the program as:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/lli --polyglot --insight=agent-limit.js --experimental-options sieve
Computed 97 primes in 181 ms. Last one is 509
GraalVM Insight: nextNatural method called 1000 times. enough!
        at <js> :anonymous(<eval>:7:117-185)
        at <llvm> nextNatural(agent-sieve.c:14:186-221)
        at <llvm> nextPrime(agent-sieve.c:74:1409)
        at <llvm> measure(agent-sieve.c:104:1955)
        at <llvm> main(agent-sieve.c:123:2452)
```

It is possible to access primitive local variables from the native code. Replace
the above Insight script with

```js
insight.on('enter', function(ctx, frame) {
    print(`found new prime number ${frame.n}`);
}, {
    roots: true,
    rootNameFilter: (n) => n === 'newFilter'
});
```

and print out a message everytime a new prime is added into the filter list:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/lli --polyglot --experimental-options --insight=agent-limit.js sieve | head -n 3
found new prime number 2
found new prime number 3
found new prime number 5
```

The mixture of `lli`, polyglot and Insight opens enormous possibilities in tracing,
controlling and interactive or batch debugging of native programs. Write in
C, C++, Fortran, Rust and inspect with JavaScript, Ruby & co.!

### Minimal Overhead when Accessing Locals

GraalVM [Insight](Insight.md) is capable to access local variables. Is that for free
or is there an inherent slowdown associated with each variable access? The answer
is: **it depends**!

Let's demonstrate the issue on [sieve.js](../../vm/benchmarks/agentscript/sieve.js) -
an algorithm to compute hundred thousand of prime numbers. It keeps the
so far found prime numbers in a linked list constructed via following
function:

```js
function Filter(number) {
    this.number = number;
    this.next = null;
    this.last = this;
}
```

First of all let's test the behavior by invoking the computation fifty times
and measuring time it takes to finish the last round:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js -e "var count=50" --file sieve.js | grep Hundred | tail -n 1
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 73 ms
```

and now let's tease the system by observing each allocation of a new prime
number slot - e.g. the call to `new Filter` constructor:

```js
var sum = 0;
var max = 0;

insight.on('enter', (ctx, frame) => {
    sum += frame.number;
    if (frame.number > max) {
        max = frame.number;
    }
}, {
  roots: true,
  rootNameFilter: 'Filter'
});

insight.on('return', (ctx, frame) => {
    log(`Hundred thousand prime numbers from 2 to ${max} has sum ${sum}`);
    sum = 0;
    max = 0;
}, {
    roots: true,
    rootNameFilter: 'measure'
});
```

Everytime a `new Filter(number)` is allocated, we capture the maximum value
of `number` (e.g. the highest prime number found) and also `sum` of all prime
numbers found so far. When the main loop in `measure` is over - e.g. we have
all hundred thousand prime numbers, we print the result. Let's try it:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js --experimental-options  -e "var count=50" --insight=sieve-filter1.js --file sieve.js | grep Hundred | tail -n 2
Hundred thousand prime numbers from 2 to 1299709 has sum 62260698721
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 288 ms
```

Well, there is a significant slowdown. What is it's reason? The primary reason
for the slowdown is the ability of GraalVM to inline the Insight frame access
to the local variable `frame.number`. Let's demonstrate it. Right now there are three
accesses - let's replace them with a single one:
```js
insight.on('enter', (ctx, frame) => {
    let n = frame.number;
    sum += n;
    if (n > max) {
        max = n;
    }
}, {
  roots: true,
  rootNameFilter: 'Filter'
});
```

after storing the `frame.number` into the temporary variable `n` we get following
performance results:

```bash
$ graalvm/bin/js --experimental-options  -e "var count=50" --insight=sieve-filter2.js --file sieve.js | grep Hundred | tail -n 2
Hundred thousand prime numbers from 2 to 1299709 has sum 62260698721
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 151 ms
```

Faster. That confirms our expectations - the access to `frame.number` isn't
inlined - e.g. it is not optimized enough right now. If we just could get
better inlining!

Luckily we can. [GraalVM EE](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) is known for having better inlining characteristics
than GraalVM CE. Let's try to use it:

```bash
$ graalvm-ee/bin/js --experimental-options  -e "var count=50" --insight=sieve-filter1.js --file sieve.js | grep Hundred | tail -n 2
Hundred thousand prime numbers from 2 to 1299709 has sum 62260698721
Hundred thousand prime numbers in 76 ms
```

Voilà! [Insight](Insight.md) gives us great instrumentation capabilities - when combined with
the great inlining algorithms of [GraalVM Enterprise Edition](http://graalvm.org/downloads)
we can even access local variables with almost no performance penalty!

### TODO:

GraalVM comes with a unified set of prepackaged high performance **Insight** 
insights at your convenience. 

**Insight** insights scripts are primarily targeted
towards ease of use in microservices area - e.g. logging


**Insight** is an ideal tool for practicing *aspects oriented programming*
in a completely language agnostic way.
- inspect values, types at invocation or allocation sites, gathering useful information
- modify computed values, interrupt execution 

- powerful tools to help you write, debug, manage, and organize
your **Insight** insights scripts. It is a matter of pressing a single button
to enable selected **Insight** insight and a matter of another click to 
disable it cleanly, returning the application to state prior to the use 
of the insight.

- *VisualVM* has been enhanced to provide a unified view of locally as well as
remotely running applications and the **Insight** insights dynamically 
applied to each of them. Enlist available *HotSpot* or *native-image* based
virtual machines. Connect to them on demand. Apply selected insights. Let
them gather their data. Obtain the data and analyze them with the integrated
graphical tools. Disable the insights and disconnect. Let the application run
at its original full speed.
